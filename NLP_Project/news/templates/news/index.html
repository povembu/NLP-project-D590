                    <p>Surprise, surprise -- the story about the accidental death of former President Barack Obama's chef isn't entirely what it was initially made out to be.</p>
                    <p>In July, the drowned body of Tafari Campbell, the private chef of former President Obama, was found in a pond on the southern shore of Martha’s Vineyard near the Obamas’ estate.</p>
                    <p>Within days, the police had ruled the death an accident, stonewalling any questioning from the media about the mysterious identity of the eye witness in the case and why Campbell was characterized as not being "a great swimmer" despite social media videos of him showing off his considerable swimming skills.</p>
                    <p>There was also that mysterious blank in the police call logs that night -- the only call that wasn't logged that night was the call reporting Campbell's drowning.</p>
                    <p>The call log of the 911 call about Obama’s chef drowning was left blank. Every other call that night has a reason listed.</p>
